    <h1>Introducing CodeProject SenseAI</h1>
    <div style="margin: -15px 0 20px 0;"><code>Alpha 1.0</code></div>

    <p>Our standalone, self-hosted, fast, free and Open Source Artificial Intelligence microserver for
    any platform, any language.</p>

    <h2>To Get Started</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start the CodeProject SenseAI Server by double-clicking the 
        <code>Start_SenseAI_Win.bat</code> file</li>
        <li>Open the <a href="./demos/javascript/vision.html" style="font-weight:bold">CodeProject 
        SenseAI Playground</a> to explore the capabilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
        This is a developer preview full of sharp edges and exciting ledges, but that's part of what
        makes this fun. <a href="https://github.com/codeproject/CodeProject.SenseAI">Grab the code</a>
        and try out the playground. We're looking for help, ideas, and anyone willing to dig in
        make this amazing.

    <h2>What is CodeProject SenseAI Server?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI is a self contained server that allows other applications to easily i
        nclude AI processing as part of their service. CodeProject SenseAI is a simple HTTP based 
        REST service that is fully self contained, installed locally, and requires no off-device 
        processing.</p>

    <h2>What does it include?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI includes</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A HTTP REST API Server</b>. The server listens for requests from other apps, 
            passes them to the backend analysis services for processing, and then passes the
            results back to the caller. It runs as a simple self contained web service on your
            device.</li>
        <li><b>Backend Analysis services</b>. The brains of the operation is in the analysis
            services sitting behind the front end API. All processing of data is done on the 
            current machine. No calls to the cloud and no data leaving the device.</li>
        <li><b>The Source Code</b>, naturally.
    </ul>

    <h2>What can it do?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI can currently</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect objects in images</li>
        <li>Detect faces in images</li>
        <li>Detect the type of scene represented in an image</li>
        <li>Recognise faces that have been registered with the service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will be constantly expanding the feature list.</p>

    <h2>Why CodeProject SenseAI</h2>

    <p>Because adding AI capabilities to your apps is annoying hard.</p>
    <p>We want AI development to be something every developer can access, and we want integrating 
        AI into applications to be straightforward.</p>
    <p>AI development involves multiple formats, training techniques, large amounts of data,
        inscrutible choices and often expensive cloud services. We don't want that. The AI that we
        include in our applications should be</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Completely self contained</b>. No sign-in, no reliance on Cloud servers, nothing to
            download at runtime. Everything you need already in place</li>
        <li><b>Safe and secure</b>. Data processed as part of the application logic should never
            leave the local environment. It should not be parsed, read, inspected or stored 
            by anyone else other than you.</li>
        <li><b>Always open</b>. CodeProject is based on Open Source development and so 
            CodeProject SenseAI will also be Open Source.</li>
        <li><b>Cross Platform</b> We don't often have the luxury of picking a single platform 
            anymore. There needs to be support for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Rasperry Pi to 
            name a few.</li>
        <li><b>Cross Architecture CPU and GPU support</b>, of course</li>
        <li><b>Fast and lightweight</b> Necessary for a self-contained distributable system</li>
        <li><b>Extendable</b>. AI is expanding so rapidly, and there are so many wonderful 
            solutions popping up daaily. Adding new capabilities must be as simple as dropping 
            in the code and registering the new capabilities with the front end server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To promote AI development and inspire the AI developer community to dive in and have a
            go. AI is here, it's in demand, and it's a huge paradigm change in the industry. 
            Whether you like AI or not, developers owe it to themselves to experiment in and 
            familiarise themselves with the technology. This is CodeProject SenseAI: a 
            demonstration, a playground, a learning tool, and a library and service that can be 
            used out of the box.</li>
        <li>To make AI development easy. It's not that AI development is that hard. It's that
            there are so, so many options. Our architecture is designed to allow any AI 
            implementation to find a home in our system, and for our service to be callable from 
            any language.</li>
        <li>To focus on core use-cases. We're deliberately not a solution for everyone. Instead 
            we're a solution for common day-to-day needs. We will be adding dozens of modules 
            and scores of AI capabilities to our system, but our goal is always clarity and 
            simplicity over a 100% solution.</li>
        <li>To tap the expertise of the Developer Community. We're not experts but we know a
            developer or two out there who are. The true power of CodeProject SenseAI comes from 
            the contributions and improvements from our AI community.</li>
    </ul>
